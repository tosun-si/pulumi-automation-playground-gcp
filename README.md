# pulumi-automation-playground-gcp

This project proposes code samples using Pulumi and the Pulumi Automation API, with infrastructure provisioned on Google Cloud.

It highlights the classical IaC approach and shows how the Pulumi Automation API brings powerful capabilities to manage infrastructure programmatically\
â€” using an API, CLI, or directly in code. This approach is especially well-suited for IaaS and PaaS scenarios
